# Hardware protocols

Reverse-engineering notes for the devices HIDra talks to. The **keyboard**
protocol was captured live by running the official Windows tool under Wine with
a `/dev/uhid` mirror of the real HID interfaces and the GUI driven by `xdotool`.
The **mouse** protocol comes from the open-source `open-m711pro` project
(validated on identical hardware) and cross-checked against `m913-ctl` /
`mouse_m908`.

All I/O is plain HID: feature reports and output/input reports. On Linux that is
`hidraw` + `HIDIOCSFEATURE`; the udev rule (`uaccess`) is installed as
`/usr/lib/udev/rules.d/70-hidra.rules` by the packages, or
`/etc/udev/rules.d/70-hidra.rules` by `packaging/install-udev.sh`.

## Where the configuration channel lives

Neither device is configured through the collection that types letters or moves
the pointer. Both put configuration on a **vendor-defined collection on USB
interface 1**, and the exact collection matters on Windows, where each top-level
collection is a separate handle:

| Device | Interface | Write collection | Reply collection |
|---|---|---|---|
| M711-PRO mouse | 1 | usage page `0xFF02`, usage `0x02` (feature report `0x08`) | usage page `0xFF01` (input report `0x09`) |
| K586RGB-PRO keyboard | 1 | usage page `0xFF1C`, usage `0x92` (report `0x04`) | same collection |

The mouse answering on a *different* collection than the one it is written to is
the reason `devices.rs` carries both `config_usage_page` and `reply_usage_page`.

## Mouse — Cobra Pro / M711-PRO (Compx `25A7:FA07` receiver, `FA08` cable)

- Config interface: **1**. **Feature** reports, id `0x08`, 17 bytes.
- Write: `08 07 00 <ADDR_HI> <ADDR_LO> <LEN> <data…> <padding> <CKSUM>`
- Read: `08 08 00 <hi> <lo> <len>`; the answer arrives as input report id `0x09`
  on the interrupt endpoint, same layout.
- Commit (apply/save): `08 04 …`, sent after every burst.
- **Checksum**: every byte sums to `0x55` (mod 256), both for the 17-byte packet
  and for each memory "record": `ck = (0x55 - sum) & 0xFF`.

### Register map
| Address | Contents |
|---|---|
| `0x0000` | Polling rate: `01`=1000 Hz, `02`=500, `04`=250, `08`=125 |
| `0x0002` | Number of active DPI stages |
| `0x000C`–`0x001F` | DPI table: 5 stages × 4 bytes (`X Y 00 ck`) |
| `0x002C`–`0x003F` | Per-stage DPI LED colour: 5 × 4 bytes (`R G B ck`) |
| `0x004C` | "DPI Effect" (stage indicator LED): `01` on, `00` off |
| `0x0060`–`0x009F` | Button table: 16 records × 4 bytes (`TYPE P1 P2 ck`) |
| `0x00A0` | LED: `EFFECT R G B SPEED BRIGHTNESS ck` |
| `0x0100 + 0x20*n` | Extended slot for button n (media / key / combo) |

- **DPI**: `byte = round(dpi*3/250) - 1` (~83.33 DPI per step);
  `dpi = (byte+1)*250/3`. Ceiling `0xBD`.
- **LED effects** (the `EFFECT` byte at `0x00A0`): `00` cycle/streaming,
  `01` breathing, `02` steady, `04` off. Brightness `0x00`–`0xFF` (`0xFF` = 100%).
  Lower speed value = faster.
- **Button action types**: `00` disabled · `01` mouse button (P1 = bitmask
  L1/R2/M4/Back8/Fwd16) · `02` DPI (`01` cycle, `02` +, `03` −) · `04`
  repeated click / fire (P1 = speed, P2 = click count) · `05` action in the
  extended slot · `07` polling switch · `08` RGB on/off.
- **Extended slot** (event list):
  `<event count> [<type> <code_lo> <code_hi>]* <ck>`. Types: `80`/`40` modifier
  down/up (HID bitmask), `81`/`41` key down/up (HID keyboard usage), `82`/`42`
  media down/up (Consumer Page usage, 16-bit). Ctrl+C =
  `04 | 80 01 00 | 81 06 00 | 40 01 00 | 41 06 00 | ck`.
- Physical index → table slot: buttons 1–5 = 0–4; button 6 (behind the wheel,
  the nearer one) = 10; button 7 = 11; button 8 = 9.

### Writes that do not apply
Reads work in both connection modes, but a write can be silently ignored while
the mouse is idle — the 2.4 GHz radio sleeps. HIDra fans every write out to all
present mouse interfaces (receiver and cable) and the awake one takes it. If a
setting does not stick, move the mouse while applying.

## Keyboard — Brahma Pro / K586RGB-PRO (SONiX SN32F248B, `0C45:5004`)

- Config interface: **1** (usage page `0xFF1C`). Output reports, id `0x04`,
  **64 bytes**. The answer comes back as input report id `0x04`.
- **Checksum**: 16-bit sum of bytes `[3..63]`, stored at `[1]` (LO) and `[2]` (HI).
- Write sequence: **BEGIN** `04 .. .. 01 00…` → the specific packets →
  **END** `04 .. .. 02 00…`.
- Command header: `04 <CK_LO> <CK_HI> <CMD> <LEN> <OFF_LO> <OFF_HI> 00 <data…>`.

### Commands
| CMD | Function |
|---|---|
| `01` / `02` | BEGIN / END (applies the batch) |
| `03` | read profile block (0x2C bytes @ 0) |
| `04` | write profile block (switches the active profile) |
| `05` | read lighting config block (0x38 @ `0x00` / `0x2A` / `0x54`) |
| `06` | write lighting parameter |
| `07` / `0f` | read keymap (factory / active) |
| `08` | write keymap (8 packets of 0x38) |
| `10` / `11` | read / write per-key colours (Custom mode) |
| `0a` | write macro table |

`07` returns the **factory** keymap and never changes; `0f` returns the active
one and reflects what was written.

### Lighting parameters (CMD `06`, shape `06 <LEN> <OFF> 00 00 <data>`)
One block per profile, at base offsets **P1 = 0x00, P2 = 0x2A, P3 = 0x54**.
Within the block:

| Offset | Field | Observed values |
|---|---|---|
| `+0` | Effect (mode) | 1..18, and 20 = Custom |
| `+1` | Brightness | 0..5 (default 5) |
| `+2` | Speed | 1..5 (default 3; lower = faster) |
| `+3` | Direction | `00` right, `FF` left |
| `+4` | Full RGB / multicolour | `00`/`01` |
| `+5..7` | Colour R,G,B | e.g. `FF 00 00`, written as `06 03 05 00 00 R G B` |

### Effects (the mode byte at `+0`)
In the order the vendor's combo box lists them (names as shipped in the
Portuguese build): 1 Corredor · 2 A Nuvem · 3 Lâmina Veloz · 4 Spectrum ·
5 Respiração · 6 Sólido · 7 Reativo · 8 Ondular · 9 Reativo (Horizontal) ·
10 Florescer Gélido · 11 Rainbow · 12 Corrida das Sombras · 13 Tornado ·
14 Recarregar · 15 A Matrix · 16 Surmount · 17 Passagem Dupla · 18 Vulto do
Spectro · **20 Custom** (per-key). IDs are index+1; Custom is `0x14`.

### Keymap (CMD `08`)
420 bytes = ~140 entries of 3 bytes, sent as 8 packets of `0x38`. Each entry:
`02 02 <usage>` (key), `02 01 <mod>` (modifier), `03 <lo> <hi>` (media),
`05 xx yy` (special functions / FN layer), `00 00 00` (empty). The factory dump
of this keyboard is in `docs/kb_default_keymap.bin`; inverting it gives
physical key → table offset. Verified: remapping Q→X applied on hardware and
read back through CMD `0f`.

### Per-key colours (CMD `11`, Custom mode)
Every key has a **fixed offset** in the LED buffer (6×20 matrix,
`offset = slot*3`). The official app paints one key at a time with
`04 .. .. 11 03 <off_lo> <off_hi> 00 <R G B>`, inside `BEGIN … END`, with the
mode set to `0x14` (Custom). The full key→offset map was measured on hardware
(clicking each key in the official app and reading the `11 03 <off>` it emitted)
and lives in `docs/custom_key_offsets.json` and `src/keyboardLayout.ts`.
Read back with CMD `10` at the same offset. Verified end to end: painting Q/A/
Space through HIDra produced exactly those keys and colours on the hardware.

### Active profile (CMD `03` read / `04` write)
Which of the 3 profiles the keyboard displays. Switch it by writing the 44-byte
block `55 aa ff 02 45 0c 04 50 04 01 <P> 38 00 00 00 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08
09 0a 0b 0c 0d 0e 0f 11 10 12 14` (+9 zero bytes) through CMD `04`, where
byte[10] `<P>` is the profile index (0..2). Read it back with CMD `03`
(byte[10] of the block). Verified: selecting a profile in HIDra switches the
profile the keyboard displays, same as the official tool.

### Macros (CMD `0a`)
Header `AA 55 <len16> 00 01 00 01 00`, followed by a count and the events; the
macro name is UTF-16. Per-event repeat counts and delays are supported.

## Capturing a protocol yourself

The recipe that produced the keyboard notes above, on Linux with no second
machine, is written up in [docs/ADDING-DEVICES.md](docs/ADDING-DEVICES.md).
