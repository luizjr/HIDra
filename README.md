Vendors ship their configuration tools for Windows only, one tool per product,
and they stop being updated. HIDra is one small app that speaks the devices'
own USB protocols, so your lighting, DPI and key remapping survive your choice
of operating system.

**Your device is not here?** HIDra is not a Redragon project — it started with
those two because they were on the author's desk. Any brand belongs in that
table, and many peripherals are rebadged siblings that speak a protocol HIDra
already knows, so adding one is often a single entry in
[`src-tauri/src/devices.rs`](src-tauri/src/devices.rs):

```sh
python3 scripts/probe-device.py     # finds the config endpoint, prints the entry
python3 scripts/sync-devices.py     # regenerates udev rules, tables, website
```

The full walkthrough is [docs/ADDING-DEVICES.md](docs/ADDING-DEVICES.md)
([em português](docs/ADDING-DEVICES.pt-BR.md)). If you would rather not touch
code, open a
[device request](https://github.com/luizjr/HIDra/issues/new?template=device-request.yml)
with the output of `python3 scripts/probe-device.py --issue`.

## Install

Grab the installer for your system from the
[latest release](https://github.com/luizjr/HIDra/releases/latest).

### Linux — `.deb`, `.rpm` or AppImage

```sh
sudo dpkg -i HIDra_*_amd64.deb        # Debian / Ubuntu / Mint / Pop!_OS
sudo rpm -i HIDra-*.x86_64.rpm        # Fedora / openSUSE
chmod +x HIDra_*.AppImage && ./HIDra_*.AppImage
```

The binary is `hidra`, so the app also runs from a terminal by that name.

The `.deb` and `.rpm` install the udev rule themselves — just **replug the
device** after installing. With the AppImage, or when running from source, add
the rule once:

```sh
sudo sh packaging/install-udev.sh          # --uninstall reverts it
```

The rule is tagged `uaccess`, which hands the `hidraw` nodes to whoever is
logged in locally — no root, no setuid, nothing running in the background.

### Windows — `.exe`

Run the `.exe` installer. It is not code-signed, so SmartScreen will show
"Windows protected your PC": click **More info → Run anyway**. No driver is
needed; Windows already exposes the vendor HID collection.

### macOS — `.dmg`

Open the `.dmg` and drag HIDra to Applications. It is not notarized, so the
first launch needs **right-click → Open**, or:

```sh
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/HIDra.app
```

> Windows and macOS builds are produced by CI but have had far less testing than
> Linux. If something misbehaves there, please
> [open an issue](https://github.com/luizjr/HIDra/issues/new/choose) — that
> feedback is exactly what those builds need.

### Development builds

Every push to `main` rebuilds all three installers and replaces the rolling
[`nightly` pre-release](https://github.com/luizjr/HIDra/releases/tag/nightly).
Use it to try a fix before it is tagged; use the
[latest release](https://github.com/luizjr/HIDra/releases/latest) otherwise.

## Staying up to date

HIDra checks for a new release a few seconds after it starts, and whenever you
click **Procurar atualizações** in the sidebar. When one is out, a strip appears
above the panels offering to install it.

How it installs depends on how you installed HIDra:

| Install | What happens |
| --- | --- |
| Windows, macOS, Linux AppImage | HIDra downloads the new build, verifies its signature and restarts into it |
| Linux `.deb` / `.rpm` | HIDra downloads the signed package and hands it to `dpkg`/`rpm` through `pkexec`, so your system asks for authorisation the way it does for any package |
| Built from source, or packaged by someone else | HIDra tells you a release is out and links to it; it never touches a build it did not make |

Every artifact is signed with the project's release key, and the app refuses
anything that does not verify — including the Linux packages, which carry their
own `.sig` next to them on the release. Nightly builds are never offered as an
update.

The check is one HTTPS request to GitHub for the release metadata. There is no
telemetry, no account, and nothing is sent about you or your hardware.


## What it does

**Mice (Cobra Pro family)**
- Lighting: steady, breathing, cycle, off — colour, brightness, speed
- DPI: 5 stages with independent X/Y, a colour per stage, stage indicator
- Buttons: remap all 8 — mouse clicks, DPI ±/cycle, a key, a combo (Ctrl+C),
  media keys, fire/rapid-fire, RGB toggle, polling switch
- Polling rate: 125 / 250 / 500 / 1000 Hz
- Reads back whatever is actually stored on the device

**Keyboards (Brahma Pro family)**
- 18 lighting effects plus **per-key** custom colours
- Colour, brightness (0–5), speed (1–5), direction, full-RGB mode
- 3 independent onboard profiles, switched from the app
- Key remapping: single key, modifier, media key, disable — plus restore factory

Everything is stored on the device itself, so it keeps working after you close
the app, reboot, or plug the device into another machine.

## Building from source

Requirements: [Rust](https://rustup.rs) ≥ 1.77, Node.js ≥ 18, and the Tauri
system dependencies for your OS
([official list](https://tauri.app/start/prerequisites/)). On Debian/Ubuntu:

```sh
sudo apt install libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev libudev-dev build-essential curl file \
                 libxdo-dev libssl-dev libayatana-appindicator3-dev librsvg2-dev
```

```sh
npm install
npm run tauri dev      # run the app in development mode
npm run tauri build    # installers land in src-tauri/target/release/bundle
```

## Troubleshooting

**Linux: black rectangles painted over parts of the window.** WebKitGTK puts
filtered elements on their own compositing layer and, on some GPU setups
(hybrid Intel + NVIDIA under Wayland, reported on WebKitGTK 2.52), blits those
layers to the wrong place. HIDra therefore uses no CSS or SVG filters at all. If
you still hit it — in this app or another Tauri one — the blunt escape hatch is
`WEBKIT_DISABLE_COMPOSITING_MODE=1 hidra`, which turns GPU compositing off
entirely.

**A setting does not stick on a wireless mouse.** The 2.4 GHz radio sleeps when
the mouse is idle. Move the mouse while pressing *Apply*, or connect the cable.

**The device shows as disconnected on Linux.** The udev rule is missing or the
device was not replugged after installing it: `sudo sh packaging/install-udev.sh`
from a source checkout (the `.deb`/`.rpm` ship it), then unplug and replug.


## How it works

The app is [Tauri](https://tauri.app): a Rust backend that owns all device I/O
and a React/TypeScript UI. There is no daemon and no kernel module — the backend
opens the device's vendor HID collection with
[`hidapi`](https://github.com/libusb/hidapi) and writes the same packets the
official tool writes.

```
src/                    React UI (one panel per device kind)
src-tauri/src/
  devices.rs            table of supported devices  ← add yours here
  hid.rs                discovery + transport, per-platform endpoint picking
  mouse.rs              Compx 17-byte protocol
  keyboard.rs           SONiX 64-byte protocol
PROTOCOL.md             byte-level notes for both protocols
```

The keyboard protocol was reverse-engineered by capturing the official Windows
tool's USB traffic; every byte of it is written down in
[`PROTOCOL.md`](PROTOCOL.md) so nobody has to do that work twice.

> The app's own interface is currently in Portuguese. Translating it is a
> well-scoped first contribution — all user-facing strings live in the React
> components under `src/`.

## Contributing

Bug reports, new device entries, protocol captures and UI work are all welcome —
see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). The most valuable contribution is a new
device: [docs/ADDING-DEVICES.md](docs/ADDING-DEVICES.md) walks through it.

Working with an AI assistant? [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) documents the
architecture and the invariants for agents ([`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) points
other tools at it), and Claude Code users get an `/add-device` command that runs
the whole flow. The hardware test still has to come from a person who owns the
device.
