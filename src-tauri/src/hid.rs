//! HID discovery and low-level transport.
//!
//! Which devices exist and where their configuration endpoint lives is data,
//! not code: it all comes from [`crate::devices::SUPPORTED`]. This module turns
//! one of those entries into an open [`Link`].
//!
//! Picking the right endpoint differs per platform, which is why a device entry
//! carries both an interface number and a usage page:
//!
//! * **Linux** exposes the whole USB interface as one `/dev/hidraw*` node, so
//!   the interface number selects it and every collection shares the handle.
//! * **Windows** splits each top-level collection into its own handle, so the
//!   usage page is what tells the vendor collection apart from the keyboard or
//!   mouse collection sitting on the same interface.
//! * **macOS** reports one device per interface, like Linux, but does not always
//!   fill in the interface number.
//!
//! We open the device fresh for each operation, which keeps us resilient to the
//! wireless mouse going to sleep and to replug.
